## Setup and Deployment

SpotifyX is designed to be easily set up and deployed, with Docker containers for both the API and the frontend, ensuring a smooth and straightforward deployment process.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Spotify API Credentials
- A Redis instance

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/notcoderguy/spotifyx.git && cd spotifyx
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**

   Create a `.env` file in the API root and fill in your Spotify API credentials and Redis host:

   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your_spotify_client_id>
   SPOTIFY_SECRET_ID=<your_spotify_secret_id>
   SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=<your_spotify_refresh_token>
   REDIS_HOST=<your_redis_host>
   WAIT_TIME=<your_desired_wait_time>
   ```

   After this create a `.env.prod` file in the website root and fill in the API host:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<your_api_base_url>
   ```

3. **Docker**

   Use Docker Compose to build and run the services:

   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start the API server alongside the React frontend, both within their respective Docker containers, fully configured and connected to your Redis instance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern UI.
- **Backend**: A FastAPI server interfaces with the Spotify API and handles data caching using Redis for optimized performance.
- **Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and scalability.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions to **SpotifyX** are **greatly appreciated**. üåü

## Inspiration

This project is highly inspired by [navotrem](https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem) and also contains some code from it in the API server although I used fastAPI instead of using flask.
